Welcome to the website of David Bowman. 

I am a Mathematics student at the University of Edinburgh in my third year. I have a passion for Mathematics and wish to pursue it further after I complete my 
Bachelor's degree. 

The primary purpose of this website is to post expositions regarding ideas that caught my attention.
